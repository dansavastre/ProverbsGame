    m_Localized: 'Welcome to Proverbs Game!


      This game will help you learn
      proverbs in an engaging and entertaining manner.


      It features two game
      modes for you to choose from:

      - a single-player game mode, where you
      will learn how to use proverbs through different question types;

      - and
      a cooperative multi-player game mode, which allows for endless entertainment.


      The
      bucket system:

      Each of the available proverbs is categorized in one
      of four possible "buckets" (proficiency categories) depending on how well you
      know them. The buckets are listed in increasing order of proficiency:

      1.
      Apprentice

      2. Journeyman

      3. Expert

      4. Master

      In
      the beginning, all proverbs are put in the journeyman bucket. While playing
      the single-player game mode, answering a question correctly will move the respective
      proverb in a higher bucket, while answering a question incorrectly will move
      it in a lower bucket.


      The single-player game mode:

      This game
      mode is played in sessions of ten questions each. Each question can be of a
      certain type, ranging from recognizing proverbs that are depicted in images,
      to filling in keywords in incomplete proverbs, to forming proverbs yourself
      from a given array of keywords. The questions that you will receive about a
      certain proverb will conform to the proficiency that you currently have with
      that proverb.

      To answer a question, you have to tap on the answer that
      you want to give.

      If you struggle with a certain question, or if you
      are simply unsure of what to answer, you can always use the hint box, which
      you can identify as a large box in the center of the screen featuring a question
      mark.

      You can end the session early, without answering every question
      in it, and the game will automatically save the answers that you gave.


      The
      multi-player game mode:

      This game mode is played in groups of two to
      four players. Each player is given two proverbs with missing keywords, as well
      as an array of possible keywords. The purpose of the game is to communicate
      with your teammates and exchange keywords with them such that everyone completes
      their given proverbs.

      To give a keyword to a teammate, simply drag the
      keyword you wish to exchange and drop it onto the box containing the teammate''s
      name at the top of the screen.

      After you completed a proverb, click
      ''Check'' to verify whether your answer is the correct one, before clicking
      on the ''Next Question'' button.

      The game automatically ends when all
      players have completed their keywords.'
